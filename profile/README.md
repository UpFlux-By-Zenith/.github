UpFlux is a cloud-based web application designed to streamline and automate updates across Quality Control System (QCS) machines, specifically in paper mills. It enables engineers to apply updates to multiple machines simultaneously by leveraging a secure, on-site server as a gateway. This process minimizes manual work, reduces downtime, and provides a ready-to-use solution for AI-driven updates with secure offline support.
